# This is a project that I am working on displaying travel destinations.  It is not complete.

## What is need:

* 1. Everything in this app is working expect the function to upload a photo.
* 2.  You might need check the database that is in destinations.py.
* 3.  The createItem.html file
* 4.  project.py is where the majority of the program is.
* 5.  This program is in python 2 you can run it using `python project.py`.  Inside the s_images folder is another python program that I used to resize all the files in that folder.  If you want to use that program it is in python3.
